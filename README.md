Flight Booking System
This project is a Flight Booking System implemented in Java, utilizing an AVL Tree for managing passenger reservations. It allows both admin and user interactions with the system, including operations such as adding, searching, and deleting flight reservations.

Features
Admin Features
View Passenger List: Displays a list of passengers for a selected flight.
Add a Flight: Adds a new flight (source and destination).
Delete a Flight: Removes a flight from the system.
User Features
Add Passenger: Adds a new passenger to a selected flight.
Search Reservation: Searches for a passenger by name.
Cancel Reservation: Removes a passenger from the flight.
Core Functionality
Data persistence using file operations.
Flight passenger data stored in separate files for each flight.
Efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with AVL Trees.

Admin Menu:
1. Display passenger list
2. Add a Flight
3. Delete a Flight
4. Exit Admin Menu

User Menu:
1. Add Passenger
2. Search Reservation
3. Cancel Reservation
